    "A robot is travelling in a oval trajectory. It is equipped with wheel odometry for odometry information and RGBD sensors for loop closure information. Due to noise in wheel odometry it generates a noisy estimate of the trajectory. Our task is to use loop closure pairs to correct the drift.\n",

    "Now calculate the residual and the Jacobian and update your parameters using LM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use LM algorithm. Regarding Jacobian calculation, you can use `jax`'s `jacobian` as part of your main code. However, you still have to separately calculate it analytically and verify if it matches with `jax`'s `jacobian` using frobenius norm `frobNorm()`). Calculation and verification is compulsory, but it is your choice to use whichever as part of your optimization. Use whichever is faster. You can also visualise your Jacobian and see the structure of the matrix (just use `plt.imshow`).\n",

As your iterations proceed, you have to print relevant information (iteration number and error value: [$F = \\frac{1}{2}  \\mathbf{f}^{\\top} \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} $ (notes on non-linear LS)](https://saishubodh.notion.site/From-linear-algebra-to-non-linear-weighted-least-squares-optimization-13cf17d318be4d45bb8577c4d3ea4a02#32832dee7d6c4ab49581463d9b784f21) at every step).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. You could start with information values of 500 for odom edges, 700 for loop closure edges, 1000 for anchor edge (same for all dimensions). However, you have to _heavily_ experiment with these values. (Given that you somehow know loop closure information is way more reliable than odometry.). At the end of your experimentation, your error $F = \\frac{1}{2}  \\mathbf{f}^{\\top} \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} $ should by < 40. Explain your experimentation in detail using tables/plots etc if necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Do not worry if you're not getting a perfect trajectory. Our parametrization was oversimplified for the sake of this project. With that being said, it is possible to get the error down to < 40 and make it at least look like an oval shaped trajectory, even if it doesn't perfectly resemble the ground truth. However, using `g2o` (seen later on), you will be getting a close to ground truth trajectory."
